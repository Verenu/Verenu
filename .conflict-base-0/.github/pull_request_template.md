## Thinking Path

<!--
  Required. Trace your reasoning from the top of the project down to this
  specific change. Start with what Verenu is, then narrow through the
  subsystem, the problem, and why this PR exists. Use blockquote style.
  Aim for 5-8 steps.

## What Changed

<!-- One bullet per logical unit of change. -->

-

## Verification

<!--
  How can a reviewer confirm this works?
  Include test commands, manual steps, or both.
  For UI changes: before/after screenshots.
  For pipeline changes: describe the test scenario (hotkey hold -> injection).
-->

-

## Risks

<!--
  What could go wrong? Call out: migration safety, breaking changes,
  clipboard/injection behavior shifts, API key exposure, hotkey timing,
  smoke test contract changes. Or "Low risk" if genuinely minor.

<!--
  Required. Which AI model assisted with this change?
  Include provider, model ID/version, and any special modes
  (e.g., extended thinking, tool use, long context).
