//! Native OS connectivity checks — read the OS's own network state instead of
//! sending a probe request, so a routine "are we online" check costs zero bytes.
//!
//! Windows reads cached state from the Network List Manager, which Windows
//! itself populates by periodically probing Microsoft's NCSI endpoints (the
//! same signal behind the taskbar Wi-Fi icon) — querying it is a local COM
//! call, no network traffic from this process at all.
//!
//! macOS has no equivalent public API for a verified "is the internet actually
//! up" flag, so this only checks local route reachability via
//! `SCNetworkReachability` (zero network traffic, but a positive result just
//! means "there's a default route", not "the WAN is actually up" — e.g. a
//! captive portal with no real internet still reads as reachable).
//!
//! Both platforms can also report false negatives (VPNs, enterprise proxies,
//! or NCSI getting stuck) — so callers should only trust a confirmed
//! `Some(true)` and treat `Some(false)`/`None` alike as "unknown, fall back
//! to an active probe" rather than concluding "offline".
