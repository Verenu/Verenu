//! Runs Silero VAD (via `transcribe_rs::vad::SileroVad`, already bundled
//! through the `onnx`/`vad-silero` crate features shared with local
//! transcription) over the recording's 16kHz samples in fixed 30ms frames.
//! This is CPU-only, local, and fast — Silero's own benchmarks put a single
//! frame at well under 1ms — so a full recording's worth of frames is cheap
//! enough to run synchronously inside a blocking task without adding
//! perceptible latency, especially since the caller runs it concurrently
//! with the network transcription call rather than gating on it first.
