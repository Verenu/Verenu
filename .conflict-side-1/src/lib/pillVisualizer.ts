// Flowing audio visualizer for the dictation pill.
//
// The row is an audio ENVELOPE visualizer: not a PCM waveform, not a spectrum.
// Distance from the centre means AGE — the newest audio appears at the two
// middle bars and travels outward as it ages, mirrored left/right.
//
// Two rewrites got us here, and the second one needed a data change rather than
// a motion change:
//
//   1. Originally every bar drew the SAME instantaneous RMS value, scaled by a
//      fixed bell curve and a procedural shimmer. The row could only pump
//      uniformly; the only variation was sine noise fighting the signal.
//
//   2. Then bars sampled a history of that same scalar, so content did travel
//      outward — but it still read as a level meter, because one RMS value per
//      50ms is fundamentally insufficient to show flow. RMS over a window
//      exists precisely to average away everything inside that window, so a
//      sustained vowel produces a near-constant stream of identical numbers.
//      Carrying an unchanging number outward is motion you cannot see.
//
// So the backend now also emits a compact short-window PEAK envelope
// (`EnvelopeTap` in media/audio.rs, ~100 f32/sec on `audio-envelope`). At 10ms
// resolution a voiced vowel carries real pitch-period and vibrato structure, so
// a held "aaaa" genuinely varies even though its average level does not. That
// variation is the flow. Nothing here is procedural: no shimmer, no noise, no
// bounce. Every wiggle on screen came off the microphone.
//
// The chain, one stage per problem:
//   envelope samples -> dB -> slow reference window -> smoothing -> ring buffer
//   -> continuously advancing playhead -> per-bar age sampling -> spring -> px
//
// Lives outside PillApp.svelte so the stages can be driven directly by tests
// rather than verified against a re-typed copy of the same maths.

// --- Stage: adaptive noise floor ---------------------------------------------
// A room is never silent. With a fan running, a fixed-width window (reference
// minus a constant) put steady broadband noise squarely in the MIDDLE of the row
// -- measured at a mean of 9.5px out of 16 with 13 direction reversals a second,
// which is the churning-ocean look. Nothing about that window knew where the
// room's floor actually was.
//
// The first attempt at fixing it tracked the MINIMUM recent level and started
// the window a fixed 7dB above it. That was worse, and instructively so: a
// moderate fan and a loud fan produced identical output, because the floor
// tracked the noise's troughs while the reference tracked its peaks, so the
// window straddled the fan's own fluctuation and expanded it to full scale. Any
// window defined by "quietest recent" and "loudest recent" does this — with only
// noise present, noise IS the signal.
//
// So the floor is the background's MEAN, and how far above it the display starts
// is derived from the background's own VARIABILITY. A 10ms peak of broadband
// noise swings several dB either side of its mean; placing the window bottom a
// few deviations up puts virtually all of that swing below the display, where it
// cannot drive the bars. Because the margin is measured rather than assumed, it
// adapts to a quiet mic, a loud mic, a hard drive, or an air conditioner without
// any per-device constant.
//
// Both statistics update only while the gate says this is background. Otherwise
// a long sentence drags the floor up behind it and the waveform shrinks
// mid-sentence.
// The floor tracks the LOW end of recent audio with an asymmetric follower:
// it rises slowly and falls quickly, so it settles onto the quiet background
// while speech, which is only ever above it, can pull it up barely at all.
//
// Asymmetric rather than a gated mean, because a gated mean can LATCH. Freezing
// the floor whenever the gate is open sounds right, but if the floor ever learns
// from speech first, the window bottom ends up above the voice, the gate never
// opens, and the row is dead permanently — measured as every scenario flat at

// what permitted the floor to rise -- so the bottom climbed until the row died,
// measured as loud speech over a fan rendering completely flat. Judging against
// raw dB relative to the floor itself depends on nothing downstream, so no such
