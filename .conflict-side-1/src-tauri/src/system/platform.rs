//! Platform capability gates that span multiple feature modules (not

/// True only for a native Intel (x86_64) macOS build — never Windows, never
/// Apple Silicon macOS.
///
/// Local on-device STT/LLM inference (`local_stt`, `local_llm`) is
/// deliberately gated off entirely on this platform: it has zero real-world
/// testing (neither the maintainer nor any current tester owns an Intel
/// Mac), and Intel Macs are old enough now that they're both increasingly
/// uncommon and generally underpowered for local LLM inference specifically
/// — running it there for the first time on a real user's machine, unable to
/// know whether it works at all, is a worse outcome than clearly saying "not
/// yet" and pointing at cloud providers instead. Revisit once there's an
/// actual Intel Mac to validate against (see docs/ROADMAP.md).
