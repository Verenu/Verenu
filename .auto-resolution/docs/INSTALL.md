# Install Verenu

Verenu is a free, open-source dictation app for Windows and macOS. There is no account or subscription. Cloud providers use API keys that you provide, while local transcription and cleanup need no key. See [Add Your API Key](API_KEYS.md).

## Windows

1. Download the latest installer from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/MONKE2525E/Verenu/releases) page:
   - `Verenu_X.Y.Z_x64_en-US.msi`, or
   - `Verenu_X.Y.Z_x64-setup.exe`
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts.
3. Launch Verenu. The first-run setup walks you through choosing local models or a cloud provider and adding a key when one is required.

Requires Windows 10 or 11. Verenu uses the built-in WebView2 runtime — no separate browser engine to install.

## macOS

1. Download the build that matches your Mac from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/MONKE2525E/Verenu/releases) page — Apple Silicon or Intel.
2. Move Verenu to your Applications folder and open it.
3. macOS may ask for permissions the first time you use Verenu. Dictation requires:
   - **Microphone** — to capture your voice while you hold the hotkey
   - **Accessibility** — to paste cleaned-up text into the app you're using and read text for corrections

Notifications are optional and only affect status and update alerts. The macOS hotkey does not require Input Monitoring.

If macOS prompts for your login password when Verenu first saves your API key to Keychain, choose **Always Allow** — this avoids repeated prompts later.

## Build from source

If you'd rather build Verenu yourself:

**Prerequisites**
- Node.js 18+
- Rust and Cargo
- Windows: WebView2 (usually already installed)
- macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MONKE2525E/Verenu.git
cd Verenu
npm install
npm run tauri build
```

For development and contribution setup, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## If your browser or OS blocks the install

Verenu isn't signed with a paid code-signing certificate, so Windows, macOS, and some browsers may warn you that the installer is from an "unknown publisher" or flag it as potentially unsafe. This is normal for open-source apps distributed outside an app store — here's how to get past each warning.

### Browser download blocks (Chrome / Edge)

When you download the installer, Chrome or Edge may say the file "isn't commonly downloaded" or "could be dangerous":

1. Click the small arrow or **`...`** next to the blocked download in your browser's download bar (or Downloads page).
2. Choose **Keep** (Chrome) or **Keep anyway** (Edge).
3. If prompted again with "Show more" details, choose **Keep anyway** / **Download anyway**.

### Windows SmartScreen

When you run the installer, you may see **"Windows protected your PC"** with a blue "Don't run" button:

1. Click **More info**.
2. Click **Run anyway**.

### macOS Gatekeeper

When you open Verenu for the first time, macOS may say it **"can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer"**:

- **Easiest**: Right-click (or Control-click) the Verenu app and choose **Open**, then click **Open** again in the confirmation dialog.
- **If that option isn't available** (macOS Sequoia and later sometimes hide it): go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll down to the security message about Verenu, and click **Open Anyway**. You may need to enter your password and confirm **Open Anyway** once more.

### Verifying the download yourself

If you want independent confirmation that an installer is clean, every release on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/MONKE2525E/Verenu/releases) page includes a **VirusTotal Review** section with a scan link for each installer file. Find the link matching the file you downloaded (e.g. `Verenu_X.Y.Z_x64-setup.exe`) and open it to see the scan results.

## Next step

Once Verenu is installed, continue with [Add Your API Key](API_KEYS.md) if you plan to use a cloud provider, or go straight to [Your First Dictation](FIRST_DICTATION.md) for a local setup.
