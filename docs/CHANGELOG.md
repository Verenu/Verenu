# Changelog

Notable project changes are recorded here. GitHub Release pages remain the source for full release descriptions, installer assets, VirusTotal links, and platform-specific download notes.

## Unreleased

- Added a Developer setting to automatically enable Developer mode on startup.
- Removed the microphone calibration step and Audio-page calibration controls; manual microphone gain remains available. Rejected quiet or speech-free captures now make a quick follow-up dictation more sensitive for a bounded number of attempts, including explicit retries.
- Fixed Windows dictation appearing to freeze after CPAL reported that the
  microphone stream was no longer available; the dead recording now shuts down
  promptly and shows a microphone error instead of later reporting a misleading
  "Recording too short" rejection.
- Added a developer-only **Ruin accessibility** toggle that dumps a compact diagnostics block into the OS accessibility tree for agent SnapShots: git SHA/branch/dirty, pipeline events, providers, mic, and stable `data-debug-id`s. Off by default. It does not include API keys, clipboard phrase, cleanup prompt text, logs, or dictated history.
- Added an optional Windows Audio setting to toggle hands-free dictation with a mute→unmute pulse on the selected microphone. Matches the selected mic across WASAPI/CPAL name variants, watches the endpoint mute bit plus USB/headset hardware mute controls on the capture path, and uses a digital-silence PCM fallback when those controls are absent — releasing that idle capture client before dictation opens the mic so the pill visualizer is not starved. Mute watching runs only while the setting is on.
- Removed orange from the native and packaged app icons. Runtime icons now use a pure black-and-white pair that follows light and dark appearance modes instead of the selected accent color.
- Fixed hands-free conversion from an active hold-to-talk dictation ending when
  the original Windows modifier chord is released; stale release events now
  have a three-second handoff window before hands-free stop gestures are
  accepted.
- Replaced the Insights speaking-pace dial with a tick-scale meter that matches the rest of the page: the tile is now left-aligned on the same baseline grid as its two neighbours, quarter marks make the scale readable at a glance, the scale ceiling grows to always clear your personal best, and the best itself is marked on the scale instead of only being named underneath.
- Fixed the main window stuttering and spiking CPU when dragged or resized quickly on Windows: moving the window no longer re-runs title-bar and icon updates per mouse event, resizes coalesce to a single refresh once the size settles, title-bar metrics are only forwarded when visible values change, and themed icons reuse cached artwork instead of re-rendering on every focus or settings event.
- Restored the Windows tray icon's classic proportions — the accent-theming rework had grown the waveform to fill ~70% of the tile edge to edge; it sits back inside the tile with real margins, keeping the sharper native-size rendering.
- Recolored the running tray, taskbar/window, and macOS Dock icons with the selected accent while preserving their existing light/dark backgrounds and bundled launcher icons.
- Added an automatic light-mode contrast backdrop for transparent app icons whose artwork is mostly white, keeping them visible without changing ordinary colorful or dark icons.
- Switched the default accent from terracotta to theme-neutral black in light mode and white in dark mode. Custom accents still override the full accent scale; the Home hotkey tile keeps colored accents exact and only lifts near-black neutrals to white for contrast.

- Context group app targets now survive versioned/nightly app updates by matching a close replacement name with publisher/developer evidence on Windows and macOS.
- Prevented the same "Often mistranscribed as" variant from mapping to multiple terms in one context group, with prompt filtering for older conflicting data.
- Reworked cleanup prompting around one default shared by every model, with explicit rule priority, conservative ambiguity handling, multilingual preservation, self-corrections and repair commands, spoken symbols and spelling, technical-token reconstruction, restrained formatting, safer number treatment, and context-assisted disambiguation.
- **The cleanup prompt is now a single template used by every model**, edited from Clean-up → Edit prompt. It used to be stored per model, so an edit made on your default was silently ignored the moment a fallback model took over. An existing per-model edit is carried over.
- Fixed Gemini 3 requests failing with `Thinking level MINIMAL is not supported for this model` — affected both cleanup and transcription on newer Gemini 3 flash models, which accept `low` but not `minimal`.
- Fixed the cleanup prompt editor opening in the bottom-right corner instead of centred.
- The model picker now lists every model a provider reports, not just the curated ones, behind a **Show N more models** toggle at the foot of the list — so a newly released model is selectable the day it ships without waiting for a Verenu update. Non-text models (image, TTS, embedding, and similar) are filtered out.
- Fixed the model picker's search icon sitting below the centre of the search field.
- Fixed the settings sidebar highlight blinking off the item under the cursor while the selection pill travelled to it.
- Added a **Legacy pages** toggle (Settings → General) that hides the standalone App Mappings, Dictionary, and Snippets pages by default in favor of Contexts, and brings them back — along with a heads-up that they're no longer actively maintained — when turned on.
- Contexts is now hidden from the primary nav while Legacy pages is on, so there's only one place to manage app tones, vocabulary, and snippets at a time.
- Fixed the App Mappings list playing an entrance animation for every existing row on first load; rows now only animate on actual reorder, matching the Dictionary list.
- Reduced the context group name limit from 120 to 30 characters and added a live character counter, and enforced it client-side with an input `maxlength` (previously unenforced, allowing names that overflowed the page).
- Fixed the context icon color picker rendering as a full-width bar instead of a compact popup near the click point.
- Context group websites are now checked for DNS existence before being saved, so a typo can't silently create a website target that will never match anything.
- Added a subtle pop-in animation when adding an app or website to a context group, without replaying it for the rest of the list when switching between context groups.
- Added `docs/CONTEXTS.md` and marked App Mappings, Dictionary, and Snippets as legacy pages across the docs.
- Fixed the Insights page stacking its summary tiles too early on narrow windows, stranding the gauge in a half-empty row — the hero band, heatmap rail, and vocabulary sections now adapt to the available column width and stay side by side down to the minimum window size.

## 0.18.1

- Removed orange from the native and packaged app icons. Runtime icons now use a pure black-and-white pair that follows light and dark appearance modes instead of the selected accent color

- Restored the classic proportions of the Windows tray icon while keeping accent coloring for running tray, taskbar, window, and macOS Dock icons
- Added light-mode contrast backdrops for transparent icons whose artwork is mostly white
- Switched the default accent to black in light mode and white in dark mode while preserving custom accent colors
- Made context app targets survive versioned and nightly app updates when publisher or developer evidence matches

- Added a model picker option for every text-capable model reported by a provider, while filtering out image, TTS, embedding, and other non-text models
- Added a Legacy pages toggle for the older App Mappings, Dictionary, and Snippets pages, with Contexts now serving as the primary home for location-aware settings
- Added website DNS validation, context name limits, character counts, compact icon color selection, and focused add-item animations
- Improved Insights responsive layout on narrow windows and fixed several settings, prompt-editor, and list-animation issues
