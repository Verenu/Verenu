# Verify the stable macOS code-signing identity is available before a signed
# build. See docs/macos-code-signing.md.
#
# WHY THIS MATTERS
# ----------------
# macOS TCC ties the Accessibility grant to the app's code
# signature (its "designated requirement"), NOT its path or bundle id. Ad-hoc
# signing (`signingIdentity: "-"`) has no stable identity, so every rebuild gets a
# different CDHash and the OS treats it as a brand-new app — silently dropping
# every permission the user granted. Symptom: System Settings shows the app as
# enabled, but the hotkey/injection stop working after a rebuild.
#
# The fix is to sign every local/release build with ONE reused self-signed
# certificate ("Open Flow Self-Signed"). The certificate is the long-lived secret:
# it must be the SAME cert forever, because end users' grants (and yours) are tied
# to that exact cert's designated requirement. Generating a fresh certificate
# would change the DR and break every existing grant — so this script NEVER
# generates one. It only verifies the canonical cert is present, optionally
# importing it from a p12 you provide.
#
# SECRETS: this committed script contains none. Passwords come from your
# environment (or an untracked `~/.openflow-signing/env.sh` that it sources).

ensure-signing-identity: signing identity '$IDENTITY_NAME' was not found and

Do NOT generate a new certificate — that changes the TCC designated requirement
and breaks every permission grant already issued to this app (yours and end
users'). Instead import the canonical certificate:

  security import <openflow-signing.p12> \\
    -k "$KEYCHAIN_PATH" -P <p12-password> \\
    -T /usr/bin/codesign -T /usr/bin/security

or set these (e.g. in $LOCAL_ENV) and re-run:

  export OPENFLOW_SIGNING_P12=<path to openflow-signing.p12>
  export OPENFLOW_SIGNING_P12_PASSWORD=<p12 password>
  export OPENFLOW_SIGNING_KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD=<build keychain password>
